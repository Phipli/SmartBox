# SmartBox
Python Library for using the Economatics Smart Box with modern computers over serial

Running the eSB_GetROM.py script (eSB.py) will need to be in the same folder, will download the ROM from a SB-01 SmartBox. The code also runs successfully for a SB-04, but it is not 100% certain that it captures the exact correct region of the devices memory map as detailed documentation is not available for this variant.

I have upladed a number of ROM versions here :

If you have any further ROM versions, I would be interested in a copy.
