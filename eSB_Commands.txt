# This is an early development version
# of a python module designed to control the
# Economatics Smart Box
# Testing is conducted on an "SB-04"

libVersion : Return this library's version number (string)

open(port) : Return True if port is opend. Suppy port as string.

close() : Close the open port. Returns True if port closed.

flush() : Empty serial input buffer

get_sb_copyright(): Return "credits" from Smart Box (string).

get_sb_ver() : Return OS ROM version number (string)

get_command_name(cmd): Return the name of the command identified by number (string)

status() : Returns this library version, whether the serial port is open and the OS ROM version (string)

d_out_on_all() : Turns all digital outputs on

d_out_off_all() : Turns all digital outputs off

d_out_all(val1) : Sets all digital outputs in one go based on an 8 bit number. Each bit represents an output.
			255 = all on, 0 = all off. 3 = the first and second output on.

d_out_on_chn(chn) : Turns on a digital output as identified by chn where chn a number between 0 and 7

d_out_off_chn(chn) : Turns off a digital output as identified by chn where chn a number between 0 and 7

d_out_chn(chn, val1) : Sets a digital output as identified by chn where chn a number between 0 and 7, to the
			value passed in val1 (0 or 1, or False or True)

d_in_all() : Returns a byte representing the status of all digital inputs (255 = all on etc.) (integer)

d_in_chn(chn) : Returns a 0 or a 1 representing the stat us of digital input chn, where chn is a value
			between 0 and 7 (number)

m_fwd_chn(chn) : Turns on motor number chn (1 to 4), in the forward direction

m_bkw_chn(chn) : Turns on motor number chn (1 to 4), in the backward direction

m_stp_chn(chn)  : Turns off motor number chn (1 to 4), in the forward direction

read_byte(addr) : Returns the contents of memory address "addr" (number)

a_sensors() : Returns a list of all sensor values - this should work on older Smart Boxes

a_sensors_new() : Returns a list of all sensor values - this should work on newer (i.e. SB-04) Smart Boxes

a_in_chn(chn) : Returns a byte representing the sensor input "chn" (1 to 4) (number)

a_in_f_chn(chn) : Returns a byte representing the sensor input "chn" (1 to 4) using "force" (number)

a_sensor_table(val1) : Returns a weird string with escape characters detailing the sensor of type "val1"
			where val1 is a number between 3 and 33
